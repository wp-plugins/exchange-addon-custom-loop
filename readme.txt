Create a custom loop for your product store pages, add selections, grid/list view and more.

== Description ==

This add-on for iThemes Exchange adds the ability to create a custom loop for the store page, including grid/list view selection, pagination, data selections and order by functionality.

New in 1.0.4: add 

= Add Grid / List View =
Set a default view, either List view, or Grid view. Define how many columns you want in a grid, and how much padding between the items. Define at which viewport width a Grid view should transform in List view.

= Add Pagination =
Set the number of products per page, and the Previous / Next Page text.

= Data Selections =
Select one, more, or all Categories, or Product Types.

= Sort Order =
Set a default Sort order for the products

= Frontend Options =
Enable or disable a grid/list button for the store, so the user can dynamically change the view. Enable or disable a "order by" dropdown, so the user can change the order in which products are displayed.

= New fields to add content before or after the loop =
This allows you to use a wysiwyg editor to add content before or after the custom loop. Add (for instance) introduction text for your categories or downloads, a slideshow, a video, anything you can thinks of. And at the bottom of your loop, add a newsletter subscription form, social / share and whatever else you wish to add.

= New in 1.0.4 =
Added wysiwyg fields to add content before and after the loop, as well as preserve existing page content and show the loop before or after existing content.

= New in 1.0.3 =
Fixed an issue where the Default Grid/List View setting wasn't being applied when frontend view wasn't enabled

= New in 1.0.2 =
* You can now choose the text (if any) to display in front of the sort order dropdown
* Added grid/list option "none" to not affect an existing loop at all, so no need to choose either grid or list. It will default to the Exchange default. Note that this will disable the grid/list selections.
* None relevant options are "greyed out" based on selections made.

== Installation ==
