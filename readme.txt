Create a custom loop for your product store pages, add selections, grid/list view and more.

== Description ==

This add-on for iThemes Exchange adds the ability to create a custom loop for the store page, including grid/list view selection, pagination, data selections and order by functionality.

= Add Grid / List View =
Set a default view, either List view, or Grid view. Define how many columns you want in a grid. Define at which viewport width a Grid view should transform in List view.

= Add Pagination =
Set the number of products per page, and the Previous / Next Page text

= Data Selections =
Select one, more, or all Categories, or Product Types

= Sort Order =
Set a default Sort order for the products

= Frontend Options =
Enable or disable a grid/list button for the store, so the user can dynamically change the view.
Enable or disable a "order by" dropdown, so the user can dynamically change the view
